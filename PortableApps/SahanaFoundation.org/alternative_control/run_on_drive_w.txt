 If you wish to run Uniform Server from a folder containing spaces in its path.

 Copy files run_on_drive_w.bat and remove_drive_w.bat to folder UniServer.
 To start servers. From folder UniServer double click file run_on_drive_w.bat

 Using this file creates a virtual drive named W mapping folder UniServer to
 its root (top level). This eliminates spaces at the expense of using a free
 drive letter.

 The above method is suitable only for running servers as a standard program.
 Do NOT use this method when installing servers as a service.

 Note 1:
 Virtual drive letter assignments are permanent, until either explicitly
 released or after a PC restart. To explicitly release drive letter first stop
 Uniform Server and from folder UniServer run the following batch file:
 remove_drive_w.bat

 Note 2:
 To change default drive letter "w" edit the following two files:

 Edit run_on_drive_w.bat Replace “W:” with “x:” where x is the new drive letter
 Edit remove_drive_w.bat Replace “W:” with “x:” where x is the new drive letter
 Ensure "x" has not been already assigned.

                                  --- End ---
